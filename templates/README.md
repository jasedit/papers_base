This directory is where repositories containing templates should be committed. Instead of having this be one massive repository, this configuration allows any number of repositories checked out here on a per-person basis.

**NOTE:** Templates should not be committed to the repository which contains this file. Instead, folders here should be other repositories containing templates. This keeps repositories smaller, and allows collaborative groups to have an opt-in system for accessing templates.
