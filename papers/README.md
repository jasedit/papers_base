This directory is where repositories containing papers should be committed. Instead of having this be one massive repository, this configuration allows any number of repositories checked out here on a per-person basis.

**NOTE:** Papers should not be committed to the repository which contains this file. Instead, folders here should be other repositories containing the papers. This keeps repositories smaller, and allows collaborative groups to have an opt-in system for accessing papers.
